# Cypress Demo

I present some of our learnings from working with [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress.html).

Currently, it just consists of the built-in examples.
I'll probably write a few that interact with [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) or something.

Some points I want to cover are:
- The runner UI
- Saving of videos even in headless mode
- The clock
- Custom commands
- Network stubbing
- Opinionated documentation
